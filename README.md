# sql-courses-company-app

This project is an sql database for a company that offers various types of courses, trainings and part-time studies.
Classes can be onsite, remote or hybrid. Languages can be various. If the language is other than Polish, there must also be an interpreter during the class to translate from the other language to Polish.
Database contains data about clients, their courses and their payments. Also contains data about our employees (lecturers and translators) and their classes (e.g. time and place).
